# Flutter_10PearlUniversityApp

I made a Flutter app that includes both how it looks and how it works behind the scenes. For how it looks, I created the different screens and buttons using Flutter's tools. For how it works, I set up things like where data is stored and how the app talks to servers. This project shows how Flutter can make mobile apps that look good and work well on different devices.
